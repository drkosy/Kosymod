I did some modification on the freeorion project to fit the game better to my likes. More information are availible at the offical [freeorion forum](https://www.freeorion.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=12489)

### Policies:
Thinktanks, Patriotism and Democracy are introduced as new policies.

Industrialism, Metropoles and Terraforming has been changed for a different behavior.

Centralisation is changed to stand for tall empires: Outpost/Colony Ships gets more expensive, the capitol looses 1 supply range, the IP cost per colony is increased, resource output of industrialism, thinktanks and metropoles is dependent on pop per planet
Interstellar Infrastructure stands for wide empires: The capitol gets 1 supply range, resource output of industrialism, thinktanks is a fixed value per colony. Metropoles gives a larger bonus per pop than with centralisation but the maximum is smaller.

Democracy is a new kind of government. To change to democracy you have to apply "Liberty" first. Than you are able to build the "Parlament" (only available at your homeworld). After it is finished apply the policy "Democracy". You now can remove the imperial palace. [This is intended to get rid of the stability-malus of scylor but works well with other species]

### Ship Weapons:
Introduced new weapons: Phasor, Point-Singularity-Projector, Stellar Converter. Death Ray is now the high end weapon for external slots and can only be found in ancient ruins.

### Buildings:
Biospheres and Paralment are new buildings.

### Rework of species:
Several changes to the traits of species and a complete rework of the likes / dislikes.

### Documentation:
English Pedia contains correct documentation of all changes, the german version is work in progress
